1. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no study on the integer polytope of asymmetric routing problems since a series of works on the ATSP and its variations .
2. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide a ..., and we present ...  . In Section 3, we provide ... algorithm, and we discuss their ... in Section 4. In Section 5,   we outline the ... procedure. In Section 6, we present ...framework. We conclude and provide directions for further research in Section 7.  

3. The majority of these earlier works focus on designing minimum path network algorithms and estimating distances that correspond to these paths. This literature explicitly considers costs related to travel distance (e.g., driver wages, equipment costs, and in-transit inventory costs).
